# Cancer_Predictor
This is a Breast Cancer Prediction model based on a logistical regression-based tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer. This project uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze a set of measurements, predicting whether a given breast mass is benign or malignant.

The application offers a user-friendly interface where medical professionals or researchers can input measurements manually or directly through instrumeents and receive instant predictions. Additionally, it visualizes the input data using a radar chart, helping users understand the underlying features influencing the prediction.

This project was developed using the publicly available [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data) for educational purposes in machine learning. While the model provides valuable insights, it is not intended for professional medical use.
